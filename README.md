# Jet-Fighters-Game
The "Jet Fighters" project is a two-player, side-scrolling shooter game developed using Python and the Pygame library. The game features two jets, one yellow and one blue, controlled by different players who aim to deplete each other's health by firing bullets. The game environment includes a sky-themed background, a mid-screen border, and distinct jet images that were manipulated using Pygame's image transformation functions. Sound effects for firing and getting hit were integrated to enhance the gameplay experience. Players move their jets using defined keyboard controls and can shoot up to five bullets at a time, with collisions being detected to manage health. The game ends when one playerâ€™s health reaches zero, displaying a win message. The project showcases the implementation of game mechanics, such as movement, shooting, collision detection, sound integration, and game state management using Pygame.
